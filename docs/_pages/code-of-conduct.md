# Code of Conduct

## 1. Problem-driven
## 2. Code first, paper second
## 3. Always ask questions
    - :heavy_check_mark: He who asks a question remains a fool for five minutes. 
    - :x: He who does not ask remains a fool forever.
## 4. Always follow the **two-pizza rule**
    > "Never have a meeting where two pizzas couldn't feed the entire group."  
    > -- Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO
