# PAPERS

We only add paper to this list before we decide to oral/poster it at our seminar.

## TODO

- [ ] move all papers from <https://bupt.github.com/conversational-ai-club> to this file.
- [ ] close the repository of https://github.com/conversational-ai-club after we had move all papers to this file.

## WISHLIST

We add paper to this list if we want to presente it later, or want to ask other members to present it, at our seminar.
